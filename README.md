# GA_learning_Snake

Group project at NOVA IMS, Lisbon, 2021

The goal of this project is to implement a program that utilises Genetic Algorithms, which is capable of learning how to play the video game classic "Snake".

The code can be found in "main". Run "snake_evolution.py" to execute the main program.
